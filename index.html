    <h3>Would we be a good fit?</h3>

    <p>Solving problems and working on new ideas are why I get up in the morning. A flat, multidisciplinary organization with transparent and straightforward communication is an environment I highly value, and I thrive on honest feedback.</p>
    <p>While I love scifi, board games and singing, I also like to stay active with running, biking, wall climbing and gym in my repertoire.</p>
    <p>Personality-wise, I identify as an INTJ in the MBTI typology.</p>
